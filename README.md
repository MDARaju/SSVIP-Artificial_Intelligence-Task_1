# SSVIP-Artificial_Intelligence-Task_1

Developed this project during internship in Space Scan. The code combines motion detection and YOLO-based object detection techniques to identify and visualize both moving objects and objects of interest in the video.
It demonstrates the integration of real-time motion analysis and deep learning object recognition, enabling applications in surveillance, security, and video analytics.
